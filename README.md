LOGOMARK
For the Provenance Blockchain Foundation, our logomark is the short form of our full logo. It is used to brand product, material, collateral, etc. when we are unable to use our full logo. 

*Under no circumstances should you distort, bend, skew, manipulate or change the color of our logo or logomark when using. **It is also recommended that you keep clear spacing around our logo. The recommended spacing is 40px all around.
